			<h1>My Experience</h2>
				<dl>
				<dt class="mart2" style="color: #3498DB">PrestigePEO</dt>
				<dd>- This past summer, the summer of 2021, I worked at <a href="https://www.prestigepeo.com/">PrestigePEO</a> as a rotational intern. Almost every week or so I rotated between departments so that I could get a better look into what each department does. The departments I worked with included benefits, accounting, workers compensation, client services, benefits operations, marketing, sales, compliance, payroll, implementation/PMO, and internal HR. I had a great experience working at PrestigePEO, and this internship proved to me that I want to continue on a business track.</dd>

				<dd>- As I saw the market for college apparel become extremely popular, I began my small company where I create original, upcycled, custom-designed items. I manage inventory of garments, sales and orders, keep records of supplies and variable costs, and market unique products and advertise my business through social media accounts. At the same time, I foster customer relationships by providing quality garments to generate referrals and future business.</dd>
				<dt class="mart2" style="color: #2ECC71">Summer with Sloane</dt>
				<dd>- During the summer of Covid-19, I started my own business as a private backyard camp counselor. Here, I organized summer camp program activities for groups of 3-8 children, ages 5-10. I planned meaningful experiences, athletic opportunities, creative games, and themed crafts. I did all of this while creating a positive, inclusive environment, supporting children for their alternative camp.</dd>
				<dt class="mart2" style="color: #F9B626">Timber Lake Camp</dt>
				<dd>- At this sleepaway camp located in Shandaken, NY, I was a counselor for two consecutive summers (2018 & 2019). I was responsible for providing a safe and fun environment for campers ages 11-12, and I collaborated with co-counselors to execute all daily and evening responsibilities for the girls. I also facilitated social and emotional needs to ensure a positive and meaningful experience for my campers.</dd>
				<dt class="mart2" style="color: #26F9F3">Babysitting</dt>
				<dd>- I was responsible for watching two young girls. I also assisted with homework, snacks, and responsibilities during afternoon and evening hours.</dd>
				<dt class="mart2" style="color: #F9264C">Math Tutor</dt>
				<dd>-I worked with middle school and high school students who were taking Geometry and Algebra to strengthen their understanding and review class lessons. I would review for  exams and assist with homework. </dd>
