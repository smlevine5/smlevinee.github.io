				<p>Hi everyone! Welcome to my very own website. Before you dive in and get to know me a little better I wanted to briefly introduce myself...</p>
				<p>My name is Sloane Levine, and I am  18 years old (which is pretty young for my grade). I grew up in a small town in Long Island, NY which is about an hour from New York City, but I currently live in Madison, WI in an off-campus apartment. This is my second year at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and I am so happy to be able to finally experience what college is really like with in-person classes.</p> 
				<p>I hope you can use this website to find out a little more about me. Feel free to explore as you please. You can also visit my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sloane-levine-ba2945217/">LinkedIn</a> for more information. Enjoy!</p>

			<p>If you have any questions feel free to email me at <b>sloanelevineee@gmail.com</b></p>
