			<h2 style="font-size: 220%; color: red;">University</h2>
			<p>I am currently a Sophomore at <strong>The University of Wisconsin-Madison</strong> studying Accounting and working towards a Digital Studies certificate. Even after visiting so many colleges and getting into almost all of the ones I applied to, I chose UW because of the vast opportunities here. I felt that those opportunities, especially in the Wisconsin School of Business, would provide me with valuable experiences to push me towards being successful in carrying out my dreams. </p>
			<p>Classes I am currently taking are Gen Bus 110, MHR 300, Econ 102, Philos 341, and LIS 351. Aside from my classes, I am also involved in clubs and greek life. I am a member of The Womens Network (TWN), Women in Financial Accounting (WIFA), and Institue of Management Accountants (IMA) where I serve as the treasurer. I am also a sisterhood member of Alpha Epsilon Phi, Sigma Chapter. </p>
			<h2 style="font-size: 220%; color: darkorange;">High School</h2>
			<p>In 2020, I graduated from my high school, <strong>Half Hollow Hills High School East</strong>. During my years at HHH HSE, I received many honors/awards/distinctions of which include National Honor Society, National Art Honor Society, Art Show Achievement, High Honor Roll, and Advanced Distinction in Visual Arts Conservatory.</p>
			<p>I was also invoved in many school clubs. In Student Government I was the Class Delegate, Vice President for 2 years, and Secretary. I was also part of the Thunderbird Newspaper which is our school newspaper. Positions I held were lifestyle editor, school news editor, and staff writer. Lastly, I was the secretary for Peer AIDS Educators club.</p>
			<p>Helping out the community and volunteering is also something that I always valued. During high school, I was involved in many community related activities. I was an Executive Board Leader and volunteer at the NY Friendship Circle. I was part of the Executive Committee, Chairperson of Recruitment and Publicity, and a Teen Ambassador for the Sunrise STEAM Team.</p>
